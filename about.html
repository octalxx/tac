      <h2>Welcome to Gentlemans Hangout for long lasting relationships, strong character and flawless manners. Attraction is universal and is based upon a law as strong as gravitation, the ongoing polarity between to people whom has become attracted by each other. These things occur naturally. Allthough most of us are undeniably affected by the motion working in the opposite direction. The motion affected by cruel life excepriences such as hurt, bad programming and false assumptions.</h2>
      <h2>That is why we are here. Welcome to reinvent your self, you badass gentleman. </h2>
