Open XAMPP Control Panel
Next to the Apache module click Start
Next to the MySQL module click Start
Navigate to XAMPP's installation directory (C:\xampp)
Open the htdocs directory
Create the following directories and files:
\-- phplogin (the directory, feel free to rename it to whatever you want.)
  |-- index.html		(Get all these files from the repository and put it in the folder you created)
  |-- style.css
  |-- authenticate.php
  |-- logout.php
  |-- home.php
  |-- profile.php

Navigate to: http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ by pressing the Admin button in the XAMPP controlpanel for MySQL
Click the Databases tab at the top
Under Create database, enter phplogin in the text box
Select utf8_general_ci as the collation
Click Create

Copy and paste 
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `accounts` (
	`id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  	`username` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  	`password` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  	`email` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=2 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

INSERT INTO `accounts` (`id`, `username`, `password`, `email`) VALUES (1, 'test', '$2y$10$SfhYIDtn.iOuCW7zfoFLuuZHX6lja4lF4XA4JqNmpiH/.P3zB8JCa', 'test@test.com');

in the "SQL" tab and press go.
This will create the necessary tables for the database to work and store the credentials.
As you see you also added the user "test" with the password "test".
You can try this in the login page to see if it works for you.
If you want to add your own user head to the register page and create it.
You'll see in the localhost/phpmyadmin/ that it got registered and the password you created is encrypted!
You can now use this user to login, cool huh?
