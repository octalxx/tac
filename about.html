  <h1>Well, hello there!</h1> 
  <h2>It took some determination out of you to look this page up. Some conviction. Good job. As it once was stated, “he that seeketh, findeth”. Friend, you are here for a reason. </h2>
  <h2>Welcome to Gentlemans Hangout for long lasting relationships, strong character and flawless manners. Attraction is universal and is based upon a law as strong as gravitation, the ongoing polarity between two people whom has become attracted by each other. These things occur naturally. Although most of us are undeniably affected by the motion working in the opposite direction. The motion affected by cruel life experiences such as hurt, bad programming and false assumptions.</h2>
  <h2>That is why we are here. Welcome to reinvent yourself, you badass gentleman.</h2>
